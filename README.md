## Week 1

### [Brainstorming](https://github.com/Group-27/Brainstorming)
A group collective work where we brainedstormed for app ideas. [See my contribution to this repository](https://github.com/Group-27/Brainstorming/pull/2).

## Week 2

### [FlshCrds](https://github.com/cherylfong/FlshCrds)
My flashCard app. This app simulates a flashcard by hiding and showing answers.

## Week 3

### [Wasp 1435](https://github.com/Group-27/Wasp-1435)
Wasp 1435 is an app that group 27 has decided to make based on [week 1's brainstorming](https://github.com/Group-27/Brainstorming).   

It merges cyber-security related topics into a game, which results as a capture the flag (CTF) like puzzle game app. This app will consist of weekly/monthly cyber-security related puzzles that will allow winners of a puzzle to meet each other and receive tangible prizes. Tangible prizes will depend on the difficulty of the puzzles and each stage will have a virtual reward to encourage progress. This app overall aims at spreading the knowledge of cyber-security through a fun interactive way and to encourage beginners to join as well. Inspired by Cicada 3301 story.
